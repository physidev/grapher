# grapher
Online interactive graphing utility.

## Real grapher
Graphs arbitrarily many functions $f: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$, in terms of a variable $x$. It supports any function allowed by [math.js](https://mathjs.org/), which does the parsing for the math expressions. [Try it out!](https://physidev.github.io/grapher/real/)

## Complex grapher
Graphs functions of the form $f: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ using [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring). I wrote a custom parser for this utility, so fewer functions are supported. [Try it out!](https://physidev.github.io/grapher/complex/)

## 3D real grapher
Graphs functions of the form $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$, written in terms of the variables $x$ and $y$. It supports any function allowed by [math.js](https://mathjs.org/), which does the parsing for the math expressions. [Try it out!](https://physidev.github.io/grapher/3D/)
